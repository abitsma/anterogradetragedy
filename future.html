        <h2>Merch?</h2>
        <p>Every good band has a mediocre merch line, shouldn't Anterograde Tragedy join on that trend? Custom merch for an underground band could make you the coolest kid on the block... or not. Honestly if there's some designes made it would be cool to have a fun merch line.</p>

        <h2>Physical Media?</h2>
        <p>What if instead of everyone pirating my music and burning it onto their own CD's, I do it for them? I'm not even sure how I would get a cool decal on the CD to begin with- but I know other bands have done it! Physical media would be a cool flex.</p>

        <h2>"Tour" dates?</h2>
        <p>Not that I'm actually going on tour, but what if I played at a venue or something? It would probably be cool to have information on that accessible so that people can find it.</p>

        <h2>What other ideas do YOU have?</h2>
        <p>Literally let me know please. I'm working on creating something cool but it's hard to juggle life and a project like this. That's why I need your input, let me know what y'all want out of this project, if you want anything at all.</p>
