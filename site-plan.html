        h1 I'm so Sorry DEMO
        (video) 
        (picture of petaluma)
        (picture of acme burger)
        "I'm so sorry" is a song that was created in the beautiful city of Petaluma, CA. 
        The coast of Cali, the vibes of the city, and a little bit of ACME burger were the real inspirations for this song. 
        Trying to capture emotions of making mistakes and the pain that they can cause is what this song is about. 

        h1 Dissapear
        (video)
        (picture of me and nephew)
        "Dissapear" is the most recent song in development, and is still very rudamentary. 
        The song was wrote to sympathize with those going through major life changes, tough times, and events that make us want to take a break. 
        
        h1 Untitled Sunset song
        (video)
        (picture of Dixon Sunset)
        This song was written while in Davis, CA. It was inspired by looking at a red sunset through a dirty window. 
        This song still has a lot to be worked out, but the beauty is there. 

        h1 OLD song (cool bass part)
        (video)
        This song has been cooking for a long time. It's been an earworm with a catchy bass line since the day it was born. 
        Still a lot of work to be done, but the perfect addition for an upcoming album.

        FUTURE IDEAS

        Merch
        p Every good band has a mediocre merch line, shouldn't Anterograde Tragedy join on that trend? 
        Custom merch for an underground band could make you the coolest kid on the block... or not. 
        Honestly if there's some designes made it would be cool to have a fun merch line. 
        
        Physical Media
        What if instead of everyone pirating my music and burning it onto their own CD's, I do it for them?
        I'm not even sure how I would get a cool decal on the CD to begin with- but I know other bands have done it!
        Physical media would be a cool flex. 

        "tour" dates?
        Not that I'm actually going on tour, but what if I played at a venue or something?
        It would probably be cool to have information on that accessible so that people can find it. 
        
        What other ideas do YOU have?
        Literally let me know please. I'm working on creating something cool but it's hard to juggle life and a project like this. 
        That's why I need your input, let me know what y'all want out of this project, if you want anything at all.
